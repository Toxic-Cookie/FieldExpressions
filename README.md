# FieldExpressions

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to use [CodingSeb's Expression Evaluator](https://github.com/codingseb/ExpressionEvaluator/wiki/Getting-Started) in inspector fields.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [FieldExpressions.dll](https://github.com/Toxic-Cookie/FieldExpressions/releases) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be located in the same folder as Resonite. For a default installation on Windows, the typical location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods`. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working, you can check your Resonite logs.
