# FieldExpressions

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to use [NCalc mathematical expressions evaluator](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc) in inspector fields.

## Installation

The mod folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.

1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [FieldExpressions.dll](https://github.com/Toxic-Cookie/FieldExpressions/releases) into your `nml_mods` folder
3. Move `NCalc.dll` & `Antlr3.Runtime.dll` into your Neos root folder.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
